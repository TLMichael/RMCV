	NEG count : acceptanceRatio    1 : 0.000488281
	Required leaf false alarm rate achieved. Branch training terminated.
	
	Summary:
	Lots of false detected box while test on a video.
	I guess the key problem is the over false alarm is too high.
	Overall false alarm rate may be estimated as (max_false_alarm_rate ^ number_of_stages)
	Overall False Alarm = 0.5^10 = 0.0009765625
	Train terminated prematurely because the required leaf false alarm rate achieved.
	So, I need to decrease the max_false_alarm_rate to promote train result.

	POS count : consumed   458 : 458
	NEG count : acceptanceRatio    3 : 2.06891e-05
	Required leaf false alarm rate achieved. Branch training terminated.
	
	Summary:
	False positive rate is lower, but correct detection rate also lower.
	In this case, Overall_False_Alarm = 0.35^10 = 0.000027585474
	I think the only way to improve ROC curve is add ture samples 
	and upgrade the quality of false samples.
